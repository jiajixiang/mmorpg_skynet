# CHANGELOG #

## Version 1.4.1 ##

* Fixed memory leak discovered by Cloud Wu
* proper tostring methods.

## Version 1.4 ##

* Lua 5.3 compatibility (or rather, some cleanup in the number handling
  department)
* socket fd's are checked against FD_SETSIZE now in select()
* changed build type to make
* converted all documentation to markdown
* fixed bug: send and sendto would not correctly return false on timeout (patch by 云风)

## Version 1.3 ##

* Unix domain sockets.
* socket:getfd(), socket:setfd()

## Version 1.2 ##

* tweaked lsocket.resolve() in order to reduce duplicates.
* there is now an experimental asynchronous dns resolver as an additional
  library included, but that is not an official part of lsocket. Please
  see doc/README_ARESOLVER in the distribution archive for more infos.
* somewhat more thorough check for whether a host address is an ip address,
  i.e. needs no resolving.
* some minor tweaks.

## Version 1.1 ##

* lsocket.connect() is now also nonblocking, apart from nameserver lookups.
* socket:status() method added to query sockets for errors (necessary
  because of non-blocking connect(), but also handy for other situations)
* nicer SIGPIPE handling, using socket or send options where possible, and
  disabling SIGPIPE for the send/sendto operation only where options are
  not available.
* the included rshttpd.lua example httpd library now supports keepalive connections.

## Version 1.0.2 ##

* just 2 more examples, one http client and one http server, to illustrate
  the hoops you have to jump through in order to take advantage of the non-
  blocking nature of lsocket.

## Version 1.0.1 ##

* enhance check of whether a nslookup is needed, should now cover all cases
* modified select() to ignore closed sockets, also calling select() without
  open sockets and without timeout is now an error (instead of blocking
  forever).
* added constant _VERSION, which contains the full version number for lsocket.
* fixed an issue that would keep the Mac's from compiling this
* some cleanup in the 5.1/5.2 compatibility department as suggested by lhf
